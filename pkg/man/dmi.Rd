\title{ Calculate BCMI for categorical (discrete) data
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{ This function calculates BCMI between a set of discrete variables
    held as columns in a matrix. It also performs jackknife bias correction and
    provides a z-score for the hypothesis of no association. Also included are
    the *.pw functions that calculate MI between two vectors only.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
dmi(dmat)
dminjk(dmat)
dmi.pw(disc1, disc2)
dminjk.pw(disc1, disc2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dmat}{ The data matrix. Each row is an observation and each column is a
      variable of interest. Should contain categorical data, all types of data
       will be coerced via factors to integers.
}
    \item{disc1}{ A vector for the pairwise version}
    \item{disc2}{ A vector for the pairwise version}
}
\details{ The results of dmi() are in many ways similar to a correlation matrix,
    with each row and column index corresponding to a given variable.
    dminjk() and dminjk.pw() just returns the MI values without performing the
    jackknife.
}
\value{ Returns a list of 3 matrices each of size \code{ncol(dmat)} by
    \code{ncol(dmat)}
    \item{mi}{ The raw MI estimates.}
    \item{bcmi}{ Jackknife bias corrected MI estimates. These are each MI value
    minus the corresponding jackknife estimate of bias.}
    \item{zvalues}{ Z-scores for each hypothesis that the corresponding 
    bcmi value is zero. These have poor statistical properties but can be useful
    as a rough measure of the strength of association.}
