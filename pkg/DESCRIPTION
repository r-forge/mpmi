Description: Uses a kernel smoothing approach to calculate mutual information
    for comparisons between all types of variables including continuous vs continuous, 
    continuous vs discrete and discrete vs discrete. Also provides jackknife
    bias correction and tests for no association. Implemented efficiently in
    Fortran 95 with OpenMP and suited to large genomic datasets.
